# Task

The weather right now is too hot to handle. Let's travel somewhere to cool off. 

We have the latitude and longitude of all the districts of Bangladesh here: 
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svsudipto/bangladesh-geojson/master/bd-districts.json
```

Using the API from open-meteo.com, we can get the temperature forcasts of each districts for upto 7 days. 
```

```

Let's make a list of the coolest 10 districts based on the average temperature at 2pm for the next 7 days. 


Now as we got the list, where do you want to travel?
